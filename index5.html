    <p class="questions">4.What are CSS combinators.</p>
    <p> Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the
        position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style
        certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS
        combinator selectors are as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Descendant combinator(space): The descendant selector matches all elements that are
            descendants of a specified element</li>
        <li>Child combinator(>): The child selector will only affect elements under a direct
            parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct
            parents.</li>
        <li>Adjacent sibling combinator(+): To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS
            stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used
            to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</li>
        <li>General sibling combinator(~): The general sibling selector follows through on all
            elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another
            element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow
            through.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="questions">5.What are pseudo selectos in css.</p>
    <p> CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those
        selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:)
        after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or
        "active", like this:
    </p>
    <p>Ex: 
        a:hover {
          /*add your style here */
        }
    </p>
    <p>
        Syntax:
        selector:pseudo-class {
            property : value;
        }
    </p>
