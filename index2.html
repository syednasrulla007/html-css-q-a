    <h3>Questions & Answers</h3>
    <p class="questions">1.What is box sizing?</p>
    <p> Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element.
        Default value of box-sizing is content-box, in this case the actual width of the box
        will be equal to the border and padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width
        + border + padding ).
        In case when box-sizing is set to be border-box, then the actual width will be equal
        to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of
        the box then it will not increase the width of the box.
    </p>
    <div class="content-box">Content box</div>
    <br>
    <div class="border-box">Border box</div>

    <p class="questions">5.What is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?
    </p>
    <p>
        display: none;
        <ul>
            <li>The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It
                does not take up any space.</li>
            <li>In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements
                to fill in.</li>
        </ul>

        display: hidden;
        <ul>
            <li>The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout
                i.e., it takes up the space.</li>
            <li>The element is hidden from view but not the page flow.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
